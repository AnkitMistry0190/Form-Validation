# Contact Form Validation
 Using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT

This project implements a client-side validation for a contact form using JavaScript. The form includes fields for name, phone number, email, and message. Each field has specific validation criteria:

- **Name**: Must be a full name with at least two words.
- **Phone**: Must be a 10-digit number.
- **Email**: Must follow a standard email format.
- **Message**: Must be at least 50 characters long.

The validation functions provide real-time feedback to the user by displaying error messages or a check icon upon successful validation. The form submission is prevented if any validation fails, ensuring that only correctly formatted data is submitted.
